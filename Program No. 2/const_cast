2.	Write a program that prompts the user to enter a pointer to an object of a certain class and then converts it to a pointer to an object of a different class using the const_cast operator. The program should then display the original pointer and the converted pointer to the user.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
  

int main(void)
{
const int x = 50;
const int* y = &x;
cout<<"old value is"<<*y<<"\n";
int* z=const_cast<int *>(y);
*z=100;
cout<<"new value is"<<*y;

}
